# Mobile-FlashCards : react-nanodegree
This is a mobile application (Android and iOS) developed in react-native that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

# Requirements of the React-Native Project
1. Use create-react-native-app to build your project.
2. Allow users to create a deck which can hold an unlimited number of cards.
3. Allow users to add a card to a specific deck.
4. The front of the card should display the question.
5. The back of the card should display the answer.
6. Users should be able to quiz themselves on a specific deck and receive a score once they're done.
7. Users should receive a notification to remind themselves to study if they haven't already for that day.

To get started:
1. clone the repository
2. cd Mobile-FlashCards : to change to the directory
3. npm install : to install all project dependencies
4. npm start: to start the development server

To Run the app:
1. You either need simulators for android/iOS or have physical devices to run the app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
